# Security Guidelines for ATS Website

## 🔐 Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the ATS website to protect sensitive data and ensure secure operations.

## 🚨 Critical Security Requirements

### **Environment Variables**
All sensitive configuration must be stored in environment variables:

```bash
# Required Environment Variables (.env.local)
DB_ATS_HOST=your_database_host
DB_ATS_PORT=3306
DB_ATS_USER=your_database_user
DB_ATS_PASSWORD=your_secure_database_password
DB_ATS_DATABASE=ats_website

DB_SCHOOL_HOST=your_school_database_host
DB_SCHOOL_PORT=3306
DB_SCHOOL_USER=your_school_database_user
DB_SCHOOL_PASSWORD=your_secure_school_password
DB_SCHOOL_DATABASE=educatio_educat

JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret_minimum_32_characters
SCHOOL_AUTH_PASSWORD=your_secure_school_authentication_password
```

### **Database Security**
- ✅ Database credentials stored in environment variables only
- ✅ Connection pooling with proper timeout settings
- ✅ Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- ✅ Separate database connections for different services
- ✅ Error logging sanitized to prevent credential exposure

### **Authentication Security**
- ✅ JWT tokens with secure secrets from environment variables
- ✅ HTTP-only cookies for token storage
- ✅ Secure cookie settings in production
- ✅ Token expiration (24 hours)
- ✅ School authentication password from environment variables

### **Chat Storage Security**
- ✅ User data encrypted in transit
- ✅ Sensitive information excluded from logs
- ✅ Session management with proper cleanup
- ✅ Database queries parameterized
- ✅ Error handling without data exposure
- ✅ Export functionality disabled for security

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### **Code Security**
- ❌ **NEVER** hardcode passwords, secrets, or credentials
- ❌ **NEVER** log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, personal data)
- ❌ **NEVER** expose database credentials in scripts or comments
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ **ALWAYS** sanitize error messages before logging
- ✅ **ALWAYS** validate and sanitize user inputs

### **Database Security**
- ✅ Use parameterized queries for all database operations
- ✅ Implement proper connection pooling
- ✅ Set appropriate connection timeouts
- ✅ Use separate database users with minimal required permissions
- ✅ Regularly rotate database passwords

### **API Security**
- ✅ Implement proper authentication for all protected endpoints
- ✅ Use HTTPS in production
- ✅ Validate all input data
- ✅ Implement rate limiting where appropriate
- ✅ Use secure HTTP headers

## 🛡️ Security Checklist

### **Pre-Deployment Security Audit**
- [ ] All environment variables properly configured
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in codebase
- [ ] Error logs sanitized
- [ ] Database connections secure
- [ ] JWT secrets strong and unique
- [ ] Authentication mechanisms tested
- [ ] HTTPS configured in production
- [ ] Security headers implemented

### **Regular Security Maintenance**
- [ ] Rotate JWT secrets quarterly
- [ ] Update database passwords regularly
- [ ] Monitor error logs for security issues
- [ ] Review and update dependencies
- [ ] Audit user permissions
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures

## 🚨 Security Incident Response

### **If Credentials Are Exposed**
1. **Immediately** rotate all affected passwords/secrets
2. **Immediately** revoke any compromised tokens
3. **Audit** access logs for unauthorized activity
4. **Update** environment variables across all environments
5. **Notify** stakeholders of the security incident
6. **Document** the incident and remediation steps

### **If Database Breach Is Suspected**
1. **Immediately** isolate affected systems
2. **Change** all database passwords
3. **Audit** database access logs
4. **Review** user data for unauthorized access
5. **Notify** users if personal data was accessed
6. **Implement** additional security measures
