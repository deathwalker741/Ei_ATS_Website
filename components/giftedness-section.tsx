              Giftedness, as defined by psychologist <strong className="text-[#850101]">Joseph Renzulli</strong>, combines above-average ability, creativity, and task commitment. Contrary to the myth that gifted students thrive without help, they often face social, emotional, and academic challenges that demand specialised support. Investing in gifted education delivers outsized returns—each <strong className="text-[#850101]">IIT</strong> graduate nurtured through such programmes generates roughly <strong className="text-[#850101]">100 jobs</strong>, and <strong className="text-[#850101]">54%</strong> of India's top 500 companies have IIT alumni on their boards. Worldwide, gifted programmes have produced leaders in science, technology, and the arts. Identifying and supporting the top 1–2% talent in early adolescence is therefore essential for national progress.
